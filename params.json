The output of a single simulation run or analysis rarely contains all the data you need; Lancet helps you generate data from many runs and analyse it using your own Python code.\r\n\r\nParameter spaces often need to be explored for the purpose of plotting, tuning, or analysis. Lancet helps you extract the information you care about from potentially enormous volumes of data generated by such parameter exploration.\r\n\r\n## Quickstart Example\r\n\r\nBelow is a simple example of how to specify, launch and collate results with Lancet. Uses the ``factor`` command for factorizing integers (part of GNU coreutils).\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import lancet\r\n\r\n>>> example_name   = 'prime_quintuplet'\r\n>>> integers       = lancet.Range('integer', 100, 115, steps=16, fp_precision=0)\r\n>>> factor_cmd     = lancet.ShellCommand(executable='factor', posargs=['integer'])\r\n# Runs locally. A QLauncher could be used to launch jobs with Grid Engine.\r\n>>> lancet.Launcher(example_name, integers, factor_cmd, output_directory='output')()\r\n\r\n# Collate and print the the primes in the input range of integers\r\n>>> def load_factors(filename):\r\n...    \\\"Return output of 'factor' command as dictionary of factors.\\\"\r\n...    with open(filename, 'r') as f:\r\n...        factor_list = f.read().replace(':', '').split()\r\n...    return dict(enumerate(int(el) for el in factor_list))\r\n\r\n>>> output_files   = lancet.FilePattern('filename', './output/*-prime*/streams/*.o*')\r\n>>> output_factors = lancet.FileInfo(output_files, 'filename',\r\n...                                  lancet.CustomFile(metadata_fn=load_factors))\r\n>>> primes = sorted(factors[0] for factors in output_factors.specs\r\n                    if factors[0]==factors[1]) # i.e. if the input integer equals the first factor\r\n>>> primes\r\n[101, 103, 107, 109, 113]  # A prime quintuplet, the closest admissable constellation of 5 primes.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n\r\nLancet is pure, platform-independent Python with minimal dependencies, and supports both Python 2 and Python 3. It is designed to be extremely flexible and lightweight, allowing researchers to use only the components they need without having to understand the whole design or all the component available.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A simple, useful core with advanced functionality strictly optional. Use what you need without learning all components.\r\n* All components use a declarative style, helping to ensure reproduciblity.\r\n* Succinctly express the high dimensional parameter spaces, without nested loops.\r\n* Easily interface with external tools using ``ShellCommand`` or quickly build a flexible, reusable interfaces to advanced simulators or analysis tools. Currently, the Topographica neural simulator is actively supported.\r\n* Seemlessly switch from running jobs locally to launching jobs on a compute cluster.\r\n* Keep your output organized together with key metadata for reproducibility.\r\n* Quickly load your data and view the parameters from previous runs.\r\n* Integrates well with other popular tools such as [IPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook) and the [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org) data analysis library.\r\n* Actively used in scientific research and publication.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nLancet's code is well documented with docstrings and reference documentation will be made available here soon. The following tutorials and examples demonstrate how Lancet components are used and should help illustrate how Lancet can be integrated in a real research workflow.\r\n\r\n#### Tutorials\r\n\r\nThe following tutorials offer step-by-step examples of how Lancet is in the IPython Notebook environment. Lancet may be used in pure Python scripts or as a library for other Python packages but the benefits of an interactive workflow are only    [Coming soon]:\r\n\r\n1. Extended quickstart\r\n2. Transforming images with ImageMagick\r\n3. Processing images (follows on from part 2)\r\n4. Dissecting the results (follows on from part 3)\r\n\r\n#### Published papers using Lancet\r\n\r\nThe following paper uses Lancet exclusively to launch and analyse simulations results.
